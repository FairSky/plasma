* Change name to:

- d-graph, dgraph, dg
- net-graph, netgraph
- p-graph, pgraph

-----------

== Moving to defrecord style:

methods:
* branch?
 - replaces the operator/op-branch-map
* plan version
* instance version

----------------

* have property operator first check in the path-tuple so it doesn't go to disk unneccessarily

* subscribe to a remote node (get a channel of events)
 - send uuid to peer, which goes into a subscription map
 - node update functions send event to subscribers after updates

Operators:

* and/or logical operators for predicates
 - AND is just appending more selection operators
 - OR we need to short-circuit on true and forward OA past
   next selection ops, else go to next selection operator

* insert node/edge
* update node/edge
* delete node/edge

* Add regular expression edge predicates for traverse operator

-------------------------------

* add versioning by saving previous versions with a new uuid and a link
