Plasma graph networking.

== Setup

Copy the script/cake file to somewhere on your PATH and then get the
dependencies with:

  $ cake deps

now you can run the unit tests with:

  $ cake test


== Usage:

For now you'll have to see the unit tests.  See the peer-test for the high-level
functionality.  Also the benchmark.* namespaces will hold small examples that
could be useful for understanding basic functionality.
